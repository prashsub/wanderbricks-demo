# Documentation Organization Enforcement

## Auto-Trigger Conditions

I will **automatically** suggest cleanup when:
- Creating any `.md` file (check location first)
- User mentions: "document", "checklist", "summary", "guide", "issue", "steps"
- Root directory has >3 `.md` files (excluding README/QUICKSTART/CHANGELOG)
- See files matching patterns: `*DEPLOYMENT*`, `*CHECKLIST*`, `ISSUE*`, `*STEPS*`, `*SUMMARY*`

## Root Directory Rules (Enforce Always)

### ✅ ALLOWED in Root (Only These)
```
README.md              # Project hub with links
QUICKSTART.md          # Commands-only quick start  
CHANGELOG.md           # Version history (optional)
LICENSE                # License file (optional)
```

### ❌ NEVER Allowed in Root
```
*DEPLOYMENT*.md        → docs/deployment/deployment-history/YYYY-MM-DD-name.md
*CHECKLIST*.md         → docs/deployment/checklist-name.md
ISSUE*.md              → docs/troubleshooting/issue-YYYY-MM-DD-description.md
*STEPS*.md             → docs/development/roadmap.md (or delete if temporary)
*SUMMARY*.md           → docs/reference/ or merge into README.md
*GUIDE*.md             → docs/deployment/ or docs/operations/
.hidden-*.md           → docs/[appropriate-category]/
```

## Standard Structure (Always Use)

```
project_root/
├── README.md                          
├── QUICKSTART.md                      
├── docs/
│   ├── deployment/
│   │   ├── deployment-guide.md
│   │   ├── pre-deployment-checklist.md
│   │   ├── deployment-checklist.md
│   │   └── deployment-history/
│   │       └── YYYY-MM-DD-description.md
│   ├── troubleshooting/
│   │   ├── common-issues.md
│   │   └── issue-YYYY-MM-DD-description.md
│   ├── architecture/
│   │   └── architecture-overview.md
│   ├── operations/
│   │   ├── monitoring.md
│   │   └── runbooks/
│   ├── development/
│   │   ├── roadmap.md
│   │   └── setup.md
│   └── reference/
│       ├── configuration.md
│       └── glossary.md
└── context/
    └── prompts/
```

## Naming Rules (Always Enforce)

| Format | Use For | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `kebab-case.md` | All docs | `deployment-guide.md` |
| `YYYY-MM-DD-description.md` | Historical/dated | `2025-01-15-bronze-deployment.md` |
| ❌ `PascalCase.md` | Never use | `DeploymentGuide.md` ❌ |
| ❌ `ALL_CAPS.md` | Never use | `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` ❌ |
| ❌ `snake_case.md` | Never use | `deployment_guide.md` ❌ |

## Automatic Response Pattern

### When Creating Documentation

**Before creating any `.md` file:**

```python
# I will always check:
if filename in ["README.md", "QUICKSTART.md", "CHANGELOG.md"]:
    location = "root"  # OK
elif "deployment" in content or "checklist" in filename:
    location = "docs/deployment/"
elif "issue" in filename or "troubleshoot" in content:
    location = "docs/troubleshooting/"
elif "architecture" in content or "design" in content:
    location = "docs/architecture/"
elif user_intent == "temporary notes":
    suggest_alternative = "Use issue tracker or delete after completion"
```

**My response format:**
```
I'll create that documentation in the correct location:
  ✅ docs/[category]/[kebab-case-name].md

I also notice these files should be organized:
  📁 DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md → docs/deployment/deployment-history/2025-01-15-summary.md
  📁 .deployment-checklist.md → docs/deployment/deployment-checklist.md
  📁 ISSUE_RESOLUTION.md → docs/troubleshooting/issue-2025-01-15-parameter-fix.md

Would you like me to reorganize these? (Say 'yes' or switch to agent mode)
```

## Proactive Cleanup Suggestions

### Trigger: User Creates Documentation

When user says:
- "Create a deployment summary" → Suggest `docs/deployment/deployment-history/YYYY-MM-DD-summary.md`
- "Document this issue" → Suggest `docs/troubleshooting/issue-YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`
- "Make a checklist" → Suggest `docs/deployment/[type]-checklist.md`
- "Write next steps" → Suggest `docs/development/roadmap.md` or "Use issue tracker instead?"

### Trigger: Multiple Files in Root

When I see >3 `.md` files in root:
```
⚠️ Root directory has [N] documentation files. 
I recommend organizing them:

Current structure:
  ❌ 7 files in root

Suggested structure:
  ✅ 3 files in root (README, QUICKSTART, CHANGELOG)
  ✅ 4 files in docs/deployment/
  
Would you like me to create a cleanup plan?
```

## Quick Cleanup Script (Offer When Needed)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Auto-organize documentation

# Create structure
mkdir -p docs/{deployment/deployment-history,troubleshooting,architecture,operations,development,reference}

# Move deployment docs (timestamp-based)
for file in *DEPLOYMENT*.md DEPLOY*.md; do
    [ -f "$file" ] && mv "$file" "docs/deployment/deployment-history/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-${file,,}"
done

# Move checklists
mv *CHECKLIST*.md *checklist*.md docs/deployment/ 2>/dev/null

# Move issues/troubleshooting
mv ISSUE*.md issue*.md docs/troubleshooting/ 2>/dev/null

# Move summaries
mv *SUMMARY*.md docs/reference/ 2>/dev/null

# Convert to kebab-case
cd docs
find . -name "*.md" | while read f; do
    new=$(echo "$f" | sed 's/\([A-Z]\)/-\L\1/g' | sed 's/^-//' | tr '_' '-' | tr -s '-')
    [ "$f" != "$new" ] && mv "$f" "$new" 2>/dev/null
done

echo "✅ Documentation organized into docs/ subdirectories"
```

## Enforcement Checklist (I Run Mentally)

Before responding to any documentation request:

- [ ] Check: Is this README/QUICKSTART/CHANGELOG? (only valid root files)
- [ ] Check: Propose correct `docs/[category]/` location
- [ ] Check: Use `kebab-case`, add date if historical
- [ ] Check: Count root `.md` files - suggest cleanup if >3
- [ ] Check: Offer to move existing misplaced files
- [ ] Update: README.md links if creating major new doc

## Examples

### ✅ Good (I Always Do This)

```markdown
User: "Create a deployment checklist"

My response:
I'll create: docs/deployment/deployment-checklist.md

I also see these in root that should be moved:
- DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md → docs/deployment/deployment-history/2025-01-15-summary.md
- PRE_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md → docs/deployment/pre-deployment-checklist.md

Want me to reorganize? (Switch to agent mode)
```

### ❌ Bad (I Never Do This)

```markdown
User: "Create a deployment checklist"

My response:
I'll create: DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md ❌ (Wrong location!)

[Just creates file without checking structure] ❌
```

## Special Cases

### Temporary Files
If user wants "quick notes" or "temporary file":
```
Suggest: Use your IDE scratch file or issue tracker
Alternative: docs/development/wip-notes.md (but add reminder to delete)
```

### Historical Records
Always preserve, never delete:
```
docs/deployment/deployment-history/YYYY-MM-DD-description.md
docs/troubleshooting/issue-YYYY-MM-DD-description.md
```

### Consolidation Opportunity
If I see duplicate content:
```
User, I notice:
- README.md has deployment info (100 lines)
- docs/deployment/deployment-guide.md has same content
- QUICKSTART.md duplicates some steps

Suggest:
- Keep brief summary in README with link
- Full guide in docs/deployment/deployment-guide.md
- QUICKSTART only has commands, links to guide for details
```

## Integration with Existing Rules

This rule works with:
- `20-cursor-rules.mdc` - Rule creation standards
- All Databricks rules - Technical implementation (those stay in `.cursor/rules/`)
- Context prompts - Domain knowledge (those stay in `context/prompts/`)

**Clear separation:**
- `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` - AI behavior rules
- `context/prompts/` - Domain context for AI
- `docs/` - Human-readable documentation

## Summary: What I Will Always Do

1. ✅ Check location before creating any `.md` file
2. ✅ Suggest correct `docs/[category]/` location
3. ✅ Use `kebab-case.md` naming
4. ✅ Add dates for historical docs (`YYYY-MM-DD-`)
5. ✅ Proactively suggest cleanup when root has >3 files
6. ✅ Offer cleanup script when I see misorganized files
7. ✅ Never create status/summary/checklist files in root
8. ✅ Always preserve historical records in `deployment-history/`
